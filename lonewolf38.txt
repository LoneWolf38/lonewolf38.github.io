Hi, I'm Ankit Panda @<a href="http://sudoankit.github.io">sudoankit.<i class="em em-trollface"></i> </a> <!-- laglaglaglaglaglag --><p>I'm an undergraduate at IIIT-BH in Computer Science. 

I am particularly interested in <span id="b"> machine learning, natural language processing, particle physics and a bit of neuroscience.</span>

Sometimes I do write weird pieces of code only understood by me. Sorry.

While Iâ€™m not digging into any of that, I read, cook, hit the gym, listen to music and write <a href="https://sudoankit.github.io/italics/">literature.</a>

I really do love <a href="https://github.com/sudoankit">open source</a> and lately am falling in love with machine learning, Go and R.

I really would love to talk, listen and share what I know with you and also would learn from you, so drop me an email at :
