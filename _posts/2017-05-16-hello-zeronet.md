Every one wants to publish their own websites and blogs but some don't want the hosting fees, some care about their anonymity, some worry that their data will be hacked. Now there's a solution to this problem: ZeroNet.

ZeroNet is a decentralized censorship-resistant web-platform for static and dynamic websites using Bitcoin crypto and Bittorrent Network.

Everyone of us must be familiar with "torrent". This is because most of the file sharing (>200mb) over the internet is done through BitTorrent Network. For those who don't know BitTorrent is a communication protocol of P2P file sharing which is used to distribute data and files which are of larger sizes over internet.The BitTorrent protocol can be used to reduce the server and network impact of distributing large files. Rather than downloading a file from a single source server, the BitTorrent protocol allows users to join a "swarm" of hosts to upload to/download from each other simultaneously. The protocol is an alternative to the older single source, multiple mirror sources technique for distributing data, and can work effectively over networks with lower bandwidth. Using the BitTorrent protocol, several basic computers, such as home computers, can replace large servers while efficiently distributing files to many recipients. This lower bandwidth usage also helps prevent large spikes in internet traffic in a given area, keeping internet speeds higher for all users in general, regardless of whether or not they use the BitTorrent protocol.

But main question arises how ZeroNet is using this as a web platform for hosting websites?

As we all know websites are nothing but a collection of web pages stored in a web server which in turn is connected to internet. As a web server is used to store this web pages and distribute them to the computers which are trying to access that website so why not use the BitTorrent Protocol instead of regular internet protocols like http and https. This is the basic idea behind ZeroNet. When we try to access any website we basically do the same thing but we never download the whole website web pages to our local hard drive instead they are only displayed on our web browsers. Instead of this we can download the whole website files and start serving the website as a web server as we did in Torrent network (movies,videos,etc). ZeroNet also uses BitCoin Encryption which is self explanatory as to how safe and secure this network is. This is an excellent replacement for Github websites, best place for hosting web blogs and marketing websites and news websites. You can also use the Tor network to hide your real IP address.

If you believe in open,free,uncensored network and communication then ZeroNet is the place for you.

Users can publish static or dynamic websites into ZeroNet and visitors can choose to also serve the website. Websites will remain online even if it is being served by only one peer.

When a site is updated by its owner, all nodes serving that site (previous visitors) will receive only the incremental updates done to the site content.

ZeroNet comes with a built-in SQL database. This makes content-heavy site development easy. The DB is also synced with hosting nodes with incremental updates.
Why ZeroNet?
     We believe in open, free, and uncensored communication.
    No censorship: After something is published there is no way to remove it.
    No single point of failure: Content remains online even if only one peer is serving it.
    Impossible to shut down: It's nowhere because it's everywhere. Content is served by any user who wishes to.
    Fast: ZeroNet uses BitTorrent technology to deliver content faster than centralised servers.
    Works offline: You can access the site even if your internet is unavailable.
    Secure: Content ownership is secured using the same cryptography that secures your Bitcoin wallet.

Features:
    Easy, zero configuration setup.
    Password-less BIP32 based authorization: Your account is protected by the same cryptography as your Bitcoin wallet.
    Real-time updated sites.
    Namecoin .bit domains support.
    SQL Database support: Allows for easier site development and faster page load times.
    Anonymity: Full Tor network support with .onion hidden services instead of ipv4 addresses
    TLS encrypted connections.
    Automatic, uPnP port opening.
    Plugin for multiuser (openproxy) support.
    Works with any browser/OS.

Other Benefits of ZeroNet:
    100% transparent sites: Anyone can audit the full working mechanism
    One click site cloning:Create your own version of any site
    No backend code: Execute SQL commands directly from javascript with zero network latency
    Instant CDN: Your content will be distributed around the world
    Could work on non-internet networks( Bluetooth, Wifi-direct, Radio communication Meshnets)
    Zero Discrimination: Same Zero cost infrastructure and opportunity for anyone
    Zero trust: Impossible to modify your site without the private key
